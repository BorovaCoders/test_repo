# test_repo
It is the first mutual repository of Roma and Victor.
It was created to try using git and GitHub.

Victor add here anything you want!

Now, it is your turn!
Try:
# git clone https://github.com/BorovaCoders/test_repo.git
Then change/add something! Very usefull command meantime are
# git status
And
# git diff
Then
# git add <file>
Then
git commit -m "My super cool commit:)"
To check whether you have create commit and see commits list:
# git log
And push it! And the world would see your work.
# git push

Good Luck!
You have already done it.
Just small intro to git:)

P.S. These are the most used commands.
There are also several with branches,
but we will cover them later.
