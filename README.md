# test_repo
It is the first mutual repository of Roma and Victor.
It was created to try using git and GitHub.

Victor, please add here anything you want!!!!

To clone repo on your machine, run:
> git clone https://github.com/BorovaCoders/test_repo.git

Then change/add something!
Very useful commands meantime are
> git status
To see changed files.
> git diff
To see changed content.
> git add <file>
To stage file (i.e. prepare for commit).

When you are ready to create commit, run
> git commit -m "My super cool commit:)"

You could also see list of all commits with:
> git log

Then push it on github! And the world would see your hard work.
> git push

I see, that you have already done similar, but more than year ago.
I hope this small tutorial would be helpful to remind main git commands.
Good Luck!
