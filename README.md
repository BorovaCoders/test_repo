# test_repo
It is the first mutual repository of Roma and Victor.
It was created to try using git and GitHub.

Victor add here anything you want!


Not, it is your turn!
Try:
# git clone https://github.com/BorovaCoders/test_repo.git
Then change/add something! 
Then
# git add <file>
Then
git commit -m "My super cool commit:)"
And push it! And the world would see your work.
# git push

Good Luck!
You have already done it.
Just small refresher.
