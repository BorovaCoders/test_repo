I just finished my first coursera ML programming assignment.
I added it to repo into folder hm1.
Note: Most of code is already prepared by coursera lecturer.
I don't write so much code, just complete some file.
More info in ex1.pdf!

To finish 2nd week of course I need to watch a few videos about Octave
and pass Octave Quiz. Hopefully I will finish it on next week.

I have finally installed MATLAB and started to do my homework.
Indeed it is MUCH smoother experience with MATLAB on Mac OS X than
with Octave. It just works out of the box unlike Octave.
I have some problem with plot + Octave IDE is really succ on mac.

End of July 2015
I tried to install MATLAB during my vacation.
But failed due to poor wifi.

Mid of July 2015
I have installed Octave and started to do homework.
But it was SO-O-O painful.
I have decided to install MATLAB in nearest future:)

Early July 2015
I signed on ML course, downloaded Android app on my phone
and started to watch videos during my commuting to work.
